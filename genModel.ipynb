    "- Stages ($k_j$) that each participant is in. \n",

    "First, the `participant` id is $67$. The `biomarker` indicates each of the five biomarkers examined and measured. The `measurement` is the biomarkers' measurement. `k_j` is the participant's stage. If this stage is above 0, it means `Diseased = True`. `S_n` indicates the $n$-th rank in the order. If `k_j < S_n`, it means the participant's stage hasn't reached that biomarker's rank; therefore, this biomarker is `not affected`. If `k_j >= S_n`, then this biomarker is `affected`. \n",
