    "## Overview of Event-Based Model (EBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "EBM provides a statistical model to understand disease progression through biomarkers. Using EBM, we can estimate the likelihood of biomarker measurements or generate synthetic data of biomarker measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the order in which a disease affects biomarkers is $S$. For example, $S$ = ['biomarker1', 'biomarker3', 'biomarker2'].\n",
    "\n",
    "We also suppose biomarker measurements following Gaussian distributions. When a biomarker is affected by the disease, the parameters, i.e., mean and standard deviation of its normal distribution is called $\\theta$. When it is not affected by the disease, the parameters are called $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disease stage of a participant is $k_j$. To simplify things, let us assume the total number of disease stages is equal to the number of biomarkers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## EBM Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "EBM can be used in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the likelihood of biomarker measurements\n",
    "2. Generate biomarker measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculate the Likelihood of Biomarker Measurements {#sec-calc-ll}\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have one participant's measurement data of five biomarkers:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Data](img/sample_data.png){#fig-sample-data}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the question is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">What is the likelihood of this participant having this sequence of biomarker data, given that we know $S, \\theta, \\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ is the order in which different biomarkers get affected by the disease. It is the column of $S_n$ in the above data. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta$ for each biomarker is the $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ of normal distribution of biomarker measurement when the biomarker is affected by the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi$ for each biomarker is the $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$ of normal distribution of biomarker measurement when the biomarker is **NOT** affected by the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we explain how to calculate this likelihood in two scenartios: (1) known $k_j$ and (2) unknown $k_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Known $k_j$\n",
    "\n",

    "This equation compuates the likelihood of the observed biomarker data of a specific participant, given that we know the disease stage this patient is at ($k_j$). \n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ is an **orded array** of biomarkers that are affected by the disease, for example, $[b, a, d, c]$. This means that biomarker $b$ is affected at stage 1. At stage 2, biomarker $b$ and $a$ will be affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $S(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ biomarker according to $S$. For example $S_1$ will be biomarker $b$. \n",

    "- $\\theta_{S(i)}$ is the parameters for the probability density function (PDF) of observed value of biomarker $S(i)$ when this biomarker has been affected by the disease. Let's assume this distribution is a Gaussian distribution with means of $[45, 50, 55, 60]$ and a standard deviation of $5$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\phi_{S(i)}$ is the parameters for the probability density function (PDF) of observed value of biomarker $S(i)$ when this biomarker has **NOT** been affected by the disease. Let's assume this distribution is a Gaussian distribution with means of $[25, 30, 35, 40]$ and a standard deviation of $3$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X_j$ is an array representing the patient's observed data for all biomarker. Assume the data is $[77, 45, 53, 90]$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$.\n",

    "We assume that the patient is at stage $2$ of this disease; hence $k_j = 2$. \n",

    "Next, we are going to calculate $p(X_j|S, z_j = 1, k_j)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "When $i = 1$, we have $S_{(i)} = b$ and $X_{S_{(i)}} = X_b = 45$. So\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $k_j = 2$, so biomarker $b$ and $a$ are affected. We should use the distribution of $\\theta_b$; therefore, we should plug in $\\mu = 45, \\sigma = 5$ in the above equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same for $i$ = 2, 3, and 4. \n",

    "\n",
    "We assume that all five stages (including $k_j = 0$) are equally likely. \n",

    "We do not know $k_j$, so the best option is to calculate the \"average\" likelihood of all the biomarker data. \n",

For example, if L2 is much larger than L1, L3, and L4, then we know this participant is most likely to be at stage 2. \n",

Because this number tends to be very large, we take the natural log of $L$, i.e., $\\ln(L)$."
