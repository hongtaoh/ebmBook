    "# Calculating the Likelihood of Biomarker Measurements\n",

    "Suppose we have a participant's data, for example, @fig-sample-data. Now, the question is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">What is the likelihood of this participant having this sequence of biomarker data, given that we know $S, k_j, \\theta, \\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we explain how to calculate this likelihood in two scenartios: (1) known $k_j$ and (2) unknown $k_j$.\n",

    "## Known $k_j$\n",

    "This equation compuates the likelihood of the observed biomarker data of a specific participant, given that we know the disease stage this patient is at ($k_j$). \n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ is an **orded array** of biomarkers that are affected by the disease, for example, $[b, a, d, c]$. This means that biomarker $b$ is affected at stage 1. At stage 2, biomarker $b$ and $a$ will be affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $S(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ biomarker according to $S$. For example $S_1$ will be biomarker $b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $k_j$ indicates the stage the patient is at, for example, $k_j = 2$. This means that the disease has effected biomarker $a$ and $b$. Biomarker $c$ and $d$ have not been affected yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\theta_{S(i)}$ is the parameters for the probability density function (PDF) of observed value of biomarker $S(i)$ when this biomarker has been affected by the disease. Let's assume this distribution is a Gaussian distribution with means of $[45, 50, 55, 60]$ and a standard deviation of $5$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\phi_{S(i)}$ is the parameters for the probability density function (PDF) of observed value of biomarker $S(i)$ when this biomarker has **NOT** been affected by the disease. Let's assume this distribution is a Gaussian distribution with means of $[25, 30, 35, 40]$ and a standard deviation of $3$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X_j$ is an array representing the patient's observed data for all biomarker. Assume the data is $[77, 45, 53, 90]$ for biomarker $b$, $a$, $d$, and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the patient is at stage $2$ of this disease; hence $k_j = 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we are going to calculate $p(X_j|S, z_j = 1, k_j)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "When $i = 1$, we have $S_{(i)} = b$ and $X_{S_{(i)}} = X_b = 45$. So\n",

    "$$p(X_{S_{(i)}} | \\theta_{S(i)}) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{X_b - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $k_j = 2$, so biomarker $b$ and $a$ are affected. We should use the distribution of $\\theta_b$; therefore, we should plug in $\\mu = 45, \\sigma = 5$ in the above equation. \n",

    "\n",
    "The above is the likelihood of the given biomarker data when $k_j = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $p (X_b | \\theta_b)$ is probability density, a value of a probability density function at a specific point; so it is not a probability itself. \n",
